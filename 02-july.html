<p><h4>1. A programming language is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a 
computer.<br>
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data 
analysis, and automation.<br>
3. Examples: C, Java, Python, JavaScript.</h4><br><hr>

<p><h3><mark up><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/why-python">Why Python ?</a></mark up></h3></p>

<p><h4><b>1. Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br> 
<b>2.</b> Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, 
functional).<br>
<b>3. Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web 
development.<br> 
<b>4. Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.<br>
<b>5. Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br>
<b>6. Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification 
(Windows, macOS, Linux).<br> 
<b>7. Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications 
when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g., Django)</h4></p><hr>

<p><h4>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and 
readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. 
Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.

Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.<br>
<b>3. Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks.<br>
<b>4. Game Development:</b> Framework: PyGame.<br>
<b>5. Scientific Computing:</b> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.<br> 
<b>6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b> Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.<br> 
<b>7. Web Scraping:</b> Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.<br> 
<b>8. Cybersecurity:</b>Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.  </h4><br><hr>


<p><h3><mark up><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/disadvantages-of-python/">Some disadvantages of Python: </a></mark up></h3></p>

<p><h4>1. Slower Execution Speed <br>
○ Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. <br>
○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming 
engines). <br>
2. Memory Consumption <br>
○ Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage. <br>
○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial. <br>
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) <br>
○ The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time. <br>
○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core 
processors. <br>
4. Runtime Errors <br>
○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested. <br>
○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly. <br>
5. Limited Support for Low-Level Programming <br>
○ Languages like C or Rust are better suited for such tasks.</h4><br><hr>
